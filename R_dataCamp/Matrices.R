# A matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric,
# character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns.
# Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called 
# two-dimensional.

# Construct a matrix with 3 rows that contain the numbers 1 up to 9
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
