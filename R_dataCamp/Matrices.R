# A matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric,
# character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns.
# Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called 
# two-dimensional.

# Construct a matrix with 3 rows that contain the numbers 1 up to 9
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

# We'll combine all these figures into a single vector.
# Next, we'll build a matrix from this vector.

# Use c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi) to combine the three
# vectors into one vector. Call this vector box_office.
# Construct a matrix with 3 rows, where each row represents a movie.
# Use the matrix() function to this. The first argument is the vector
# box_office, containing all box office figures. Next, you'll have to
# specify nrow = 3 and byrow = TRUE. Name the resulting matrix star_wars_matrix.

# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office,  byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
