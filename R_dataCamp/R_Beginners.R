# A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.
# 
# A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g.
# a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's
# name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within 
# this variable.

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
